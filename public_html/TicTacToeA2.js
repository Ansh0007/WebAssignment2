/* Function resetGame() is called when user clicks on the "game reset" button
 1. sets content of all 9 cells to nothing
 2. sets the starting player (this version, X always starts the game)
 3. updates the message to the current player
 4. resets the number of empty cells to 9
 5. sets the game over flag to false to indicate that the game is in progress
